# sentiment-analysis-US-politicians
Using spaCy textblob and Yake!, this runs sentiment analysis on US politicians tweets to see which party (Democrat or Republican) has the higher average sentiment score. Also use Yake! to compare the most common phrases by party.

**Dataset:**
We will be using this dataset acquired from kaggle. The dataset contains two files both in .csv format. The first is a list of the political party and the representative handles, and the second are the 200 latest tweets as of May 2018 from those twitter users. 


**Research questions:**
What is the average sentiment score of politiciansâ€™ tweets by party?
What are the most common keywords used by politicians in their tweets by party?


**Plans and Tools:**
We will utilize Jupyter notebook, spaCyTextBlob (a spaCy package for sentiment analysis) and yake! (to find keywords), and pandas and numpy to handle the csv file.
